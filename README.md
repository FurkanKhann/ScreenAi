# ScreenAi

An **AI-powered clipboard tool** that fetches responses from models like **Gemini** instantly when text is copied. The goal is to reduce tab-switching and enable seamless access to LLMs from anywhere.  

Future plans include:  
- Integrating **OCR** for handling non-copiable text.  
- Enhancing the **UI** for an even better user experience.  

**Why switch tabs repeatedly when you can access LLMs anytime, anywhere?**
